### Maximize Limited Time and Working Memory

Time is limited and so is our working memory but learning is notâ€¦
As students and/or educators, we need to value time. We need to find ways on how to maximize learning with minimal effort and time. Is that really possible? We need to always give our best shot on it by:
(1)	Choosing what needs to be taught (for an educator);
(2)	Maximize teaching and learning through the use of verbal and non-verbal;
(3)	Combine declarative and procedural knowledge for better learning results;
(4)	Build-up learning starting with the basics and then to more complex ones; and
(5)	Use the peak learning time (start and end) to focus on key items and/or summarize the learnings plus find means to make the mid-class fun and exciting so as time and effort of both students and teachers are not significantly wasted;
Letâ€™s make use of time spent on learning wisely and make learning meaningful enough that it will be retained on long term memory. ðŸ˜Š
