### Basics is the Key to Expand on Learning

Learning is somehow based on building on original knowledge and expanding it. Are there no short cuts? I tried many times but I must agree, knowing the fundamentals is the key (like in counting, 1-9 first before 11-19). Though it would be possible to skip on but itâ€™s more difficult, maybe because I am creating multiple schemas instead of assimilating it. 

In the end, t requires me more effort and time (Oh no, this was not a short cut! I wasted my time, energy plus unnecessary negative emotions).

From this I would say, while university days are important (and is the one that most companies look at), the primary schooling is of equal if not of more important because this is where we start on and increase our learning by conquering our ZPDs.

Keep on learning. Fear not of creating new schemas and expanding our learnings by conquering our ZPDs (in order to expand our learning).
