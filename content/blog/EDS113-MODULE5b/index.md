### Traditional + Real Life Assessments

Preparations for assessments are pretty stressful and scary as this will define whether I would pass or fail on a subject, whether will I retain my scholarship or notâ€¦ There are so many things at stake, esp. on midterm, final exam and thesis defense or comprehensive exam on my Masteralsâ€¦ At the interim, assessments define my grade but apart from that, my future and future of the people I love. ðŸ˜Š

Honestly, I donâ€™t like assessment but the relief after every assessment (knowing that whatever comes out is my best), gives me satisfaction but not necessarily peace (as anything beyond perfection, it not good enough)â€¦ That was me decade agoâ€¦

I might be weird that I personally like traditional exams but this dates back when I made a choice to pursue the field of science. I was taught to look at things in finite form and there is little wiggle room for areas that are subject for interpretation. I was used on answering objectively and scientifically. Writing is not my thing (except if itâ€™s a mathematical or scientific report).

Hence, writing this eJournal is not on my comfort zone but I was trained to be grateful, appreciate and eventually find joy on the things that opens up on my way (and this is what I am starting to do on this EDS class).

IF and WHEN the day comes that I could be an educator, I would choose to pursue teaching on the field of science and I would still do traditional assessments. I believe theories are foundation on onesâ€™ knowledge. However, I would try to incorporate some real life assessments that would allow them to appreciate what they see on nature and connect it to science and math. By doing that, I think they would have deeper appreciation of the learning that they have obtained.
