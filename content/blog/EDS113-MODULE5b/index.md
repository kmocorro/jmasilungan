description: "Assessment Circle and Keeping Assessments Aligned and Relevant"

I am happy to have learned that, learning assessment takes a full circle, looking into how students have learned (assessment of learning), how educators will respond and adjust based on the students’ progress (assessment for learning) and personally, an even higher form of an assessment when students are able to reflect on their learning (assessment as learning).
As a former student, I am familiar with assessment of learning (exam results is the measure of my performance) and the results of such exams allows me reflect on the areas that I already know and those that I still need to improve (assessment as learning). On this module, it opened my understanding for assessment for learning and I can’t stop myself from asking the question, “Has this been used by educators properly? How did my generation (during my academic days) benefited from this?” Unfortunately, I can’t concretely answer these questions…
Aligned and not aligned assessments? In the field of science, this one is usually straightforward (assessments are usually aligned to the subject). However, there’s a bigger picture in life, it’s not just theories and exact science. How do we align assessments to adapt to the need of collaborative work and successful teamwork?

I am hoping should the day come that I am on the other side of the spectrum (i.e. an educator), I am able to utilize the assessment for learning and ensure that assessments are aligned on learning goals. While it’s important to teach the hardcore subjects, i.e. math or science, I should not forget to holistically look into the students’ learnings (i.e. developing one’s character, communication and ability to work with others in order to maximize results), as no single skill makes one highly successful on this world. 😊 I also hope that the learnings that I will gain in this PTC class, will allow me to make the appropriate teaching materials to facilitate student’s learnings based on the subjects scope and make the necessary improvement based on student’s response and in making the learning information timely and adapted to the student’s needs and in response to the changing needs of our time.
