### In the end Punishment nor Reinforcement No Longer Matter to Me
As a child, punishment and rewards were used to train me. When I do something wrong, that seemingly harmless belt (just an accessory) becomes an object of fear and pain for me. I will get hit if I make a mistake. On the other side, there’s this side of reward (positive reinforcement). I usually get extra allowance or I get to buy what I want whenever I get good grades.
Question is, which one is more effective, reinforcement or punishment? In my case, both were effective at the start but later on they both don’t matter. As a child, I needed to understand whether what I am doing is right or wrong and reinforcements and punishments helped me to understand it.  However, as I grow up, punishment and rewards are just “icing on the cake” for me. My values are defined, I know what’s right and wrong and rewards are just bonus. I need to act on based on my belief, values and goals in life and stand for what is right.
In the future, for kids (as they have minimal knowledge of what life is and what’s good and what’s bad), the use of punishment to correct a behavior or reinforcement to reward a good act should help the recognize what’s good and what’s bad. Personally, I don’t believe on harsh and violent punishments. I am believer that kids are smart and if explained properly and modelled properly, they do get it and they need not be hurt for them to learn. Although, I also recognize that pain (involved in punishment) can literally and figuratively leave scar and make us learn the hard way but not too much that it creates negative behavior and fear.
