### Me, Myself and Joyce – My Super Critique

Personally, I find am a believer of the value of self -assessment. I am quite critical about myself and I always see my errors more than the correct ones. On the positive side, this allowed me to improve my self and this served as my motivation to learn more.

The value of self-awareness and being critical to myself has also allowed me to move on the next level of my career. However, this has a drawback, as it takes much energy and time to improve oneself rather than accept things as is (and choose not to improve). And sometimes, I question myself, are all the energy and time worth the results? What if I just chose to just live my life without self-assessment and not listen to what others would say (peer feedback)? Would have I lived a happier or meaningful life…

All I can say is that, I made a decision in the past and this is what I thought to be the best at that time.

In my life, I have handled low and high performer in work and I was always surprised, a low performer usually thinks that he is doing well while a high performer always see the flaw. Now, after reading the module, I understand the value of setting the right rubrics criteria and making sure that everyone is aligned and by doing that, this can help the low performers to become high performers with the use of right procedure for self-assessment and peer assessment.

This can apply not only for academic world but also for the field of work.
Should the time that I become an educator, I would like to build a classroom experience that students to collaborative work and they feel comfortable on sharing their thoughts to others (including their feedback to their classmates) and look at it on the perspective of improvement (not something that should be taken negatively against a classmate).
