As poor student, I know that education is an enabler for a better future. I am excited to study and excel for that promise of a better future that lies ahead. That’s my end goal for studying and my measure of success after graduating.

I would say that during my college days, I poor but was a diligent student. I would comply to deadlines and requirements and would carefully study my notes and make sure I have understood it (if I fail to understand, I will just resort to memorizing it – so as I have something in my mind should a question on that topic arise). I do not blame my teachers for missing that sometimes what they teach is really not easy to understand and I felt that as a student, it is my responsibility to adjust my learning behavior and be accountable to my own learning. However, should have they made it more practical and developed a more interactive environment (I could likely learn more and could have retained more of this knowledge post-graduation). 

At one point, I don’t have the money and I need to pass a paper (that required renting a computer and printing it). Did my teacher considered that not all of us are financially privileged? That passing that paper requirement, would mean missing meals for few days? And not passing the paper does not mean, I failed to do my job as a student?

Seeing the world outside now and should the future allow me to become an educator, I would like to focus on learning that would allow my students to appreciate the subject by giving practical and real life situations wherein they could relate their learnings on. I would also, like to have engaging activities and allow them to collaborate more with their classmates, because in real life, very seldom that you have to do projects on your own. I am a believer, that the results that two or more heads (when taken actively by both or more), will potentially yield better results. 

Lastly, I don’t want poverty to stop my future students from learning, if they can write something on the paper (instead of elegantly printing it), it doesn’t matter. My assessment will not depend on how grand their presentation is. My goal would be to educate them (as fun and as engaging as possible) and minimize (if not totally eliminate the disparity between the rich and poor kids) on the class and for them to be prepared to the world outside (equipped with knowledge and learnings), that they are able to change their socio-economic status (after graduation) as a result of good and quality teaching and education.
