### To Live is To Learn! Learning drives ME! 😊

Really? The more that I learn, the more I realize that I have learned very little.
Coming from the field of science and taking PTC allowed me to see the “science of education” plus the soft skills that goes with it. 
I am highly motivated by the fact that I know little of things and there’s so much that can be unlocked. I made myself vulnerable to criticism and failure by going out of my comfort zone but this is where the BIGGEST opportunities are, as far as my growth and what I can contribute on.
I would rather GO on with learning and learn that I am NOT good enough, than to stay “GOOD ENOUGH” and limit my learning.
