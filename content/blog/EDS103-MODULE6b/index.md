### The Accepting Student to An Accommodating Teacher

I grew up learning on a traditional school, highly teacher centric and when I envision myself of becoming a teacher as well, I was confined on the thought of a typical classroom set-up, teacher teachers the lesson and students listen. The teacher is the authority and the one who sets the rule and we just follow. I was fine and accepting, but I must admit, it was kind a boring at times but being a diligent student, I followed the rules and continue on my studies.
Future wise, after learning the constructivism theory, it made me appreciate learning and teaching better. How I wish I had student centric learning… We’ll it’s not the case… Then, should the day come, I should put an effort to put my students at the center of their own learning, facilitating their learning growth and development.
