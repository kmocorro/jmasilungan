### Continuous Journey to Learning

On EDS 103, I have learned to:

(1)	Intelligence (Nurture and Nature): I have always believed that intelligence can be nurtured and I am also a believer of Science (nature of intelligence via biological make-up). However, as I grow old I was always inclined that nurture is the more critical one to success but this course made me realize that each individual is different, one can put the same nurturing amount but the results can be different.

This reminded me of how different God made each one of us. Each one will have a different skills and are complementary to others. As eductor, while it important to try to nurture the skills to the specific subject being taught, I would also like to have the skills and ability to have the right judgement on students skills and divert students in other fields should I am able to assess that their skills are of best use in a different field. 

(2)	Learning Theories (Behaviorist Theory, Constructivism, Social Learning and Information Processing Theories): I found appreciation on the assertion of each theories based from the learning topics on this course but my take on it, the theories can try to explain learning but reality is that there is no single theory that can explain learning.

This is again a reminder to me that humans are created complex (there is no single theory that can define our learning process). On the other hand, this made me: (a) cautious on the way I act especially in front of kids (as they may copy me), (b) optimize learning instruction design in a way that the students can absorb it (similar to ZPD where they can grow their current knowledge and expand on it), (3) support learning by providing scaffolds when needed, (4) value the importance of reinforcements and punishment (but these should be used cautiously) and (5) making the student as the center of the learning process.
Learning is a continuous process and we should continue on learning for as long as we live.

•	"To view learning with new lenses"
How do new insights from the course impact on 
o	how I view learners, including myself? 
o	how I look at learners, their intelligences and ways of learning?
o	the kinds of knowledge and learning processes I now value?
o	the ways that I recognize, examine, and resolve education issues?
  
•	"Making changes"
Do I sense an urge to initiate changes? 
Can I make change happen or are these seemingly futile dreams?  
How am I looking ahead into the future?
