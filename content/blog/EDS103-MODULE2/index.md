### EDS 103 Module2 EJournal: Filipinos are Intelligent And Given More Opportunities on Education, I believe we can do more ðŸ˜Š

I believe that everyone is gifted with intelligence and none of us are made alike (even on the level of intelligence). While we are gifted with intelligence influenced by of our genes and biological make-up (wiring of nerves and neurons) plus nutrition, as we go on with our lives, our experience and learning process do help us in order to improve our intelligence. Given the right set of educational tools that would allow the person to develop his intelligence (i.e. continuous growth mindset) would help to strengthen the intelligence of a person (in that specific area where his intelligence lies and cultivating the other types of intelligence should the need arise or should one make a conscious decision to do so), i.e. taking Gardnerâ€™s 8 intelligence.

Given that growth is not fixed, investing on good quality of education is essential. In a third world country like the Philippines where malnutrition (caused by poverty) and availability of access to quality education is a challenge for the poor. Then, how could we make sure everyone reaches his full potential in terms of his intelligences? Does it mean that poor Filipinos will no longer have the chance to be intelligent?

On the article written on Esquire mag, on the 2019 data, of the 11 South East Asian countries, the Philippines ranked the lowest on the IQ tests and Singapore topped the survey. Although the IQ tests measures specific intelligence aspects only. This somehow did not match my experienceâ€¦ I have travelled and worked with some other nationalities, and I would say that Filipinos are intelligent, i.e. linguistic, musical, interpersonal, and intrapersonal (plus creative, hardworking and happy people) despite the Philippines, being a 3rd world country. Why is there a contrast between the report made on the 11 South East Asian countries (Philippines raking the lowest on IQ test) and my personal experience? Reality is that my sample only represents a limited sample of population, those who may or may not be poor and all had good formal education (with most of them graduating on top universities). Then, what drove the intelligence on the people I have worked with?  There are various factors that could have contributed to such: (1) genetic and biological make-up, (2) high EQ (Emotional Quotient) and the impact of character (hardwork and determination to continue on learning despite the external factors) also plays an integral role and (3) availability of good school/universities (i.e. UP) that caters to both the rich and poor people.

Personally, even as a poor student, I have seen the benefit of going to a good school, i.e. UP, it helped me develop my logico-mathematical skills. Most of the instructional materials used by my professors, were not just lessons that remained on the 4 corners of the room. This helped me prepare intellectually and emotionally as well (as itâ€™s not a walk in the park). 

Given the positive impact brought about by nutrition to an unborn child and quality education on cultivating intelligence, our policy makers should create appropriate policies that would allow: (1) nourishment for pregnant mothers, (2) identification and cultivation of ones intelligence, (3) establishment of institutions, schools and universities that would provide quality education, (4) put enough funding (no corruption). I think this would help increase the intelligence of the Filipinos and would help us to be highly competitive across the globe. Then, more Filipinos will be recognized on their contribution to the society.
