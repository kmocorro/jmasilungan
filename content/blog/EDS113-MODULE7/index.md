### Failure Defines Life (To Continue to Live or to Leave)

In school, it all starts with learning goals that need to be assessed and rubic plays an integral role in effectively assessing studentsâ€™ performance. To be fair to students, teachers should establish proper rubic criteria and rating and it should be defined at the start. This allows the students to be aligned to what is expected from them. 

Feedback forms an essential part of the learning process and ideally it should be taken constructively but not all students are like that (some are sensitive and tends to take it negatively and impacts their future coursework). As a teacher, while it is necessary to state facts objectively, itâ€™s very important that empathy is shown to the student. A student would appreciate the understanding and kindness that their teacher would show especially during the time of failure.

We are all either once a family, a friend, a colleague of a student â€“ we are usually present during SUCCESS period (awarding ceremony or graduation) but letâ€™s us recognize that there is no better time to be with a friend or a family than to be with them during the period that they need us, i.e. in times of failure or trouble. We can serve as their support system and we can help them to see failures as an opportunity to grow and itâ€™s always good to know that someone who truly cares about you will be there whether you FAIL or SUCCEED. And someone who believe that FAILURE is just a phase and that you will eventually SUCCEED.

Literally, failure can define how life will continue or NOT. To some, it may mean their life ceases (kill oneself) after encountering a failure or to some itâ€™s a journey of lifelong learning. As future educator, may we teach to students that failure is an opportunity to learn, rediscover oneself and be better. Academic world is our practice and preparatory phase and is a good venue to develop our character and strategy on how we face life and respond on failures that can be encountered. Always treat failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. Life should NOT END when we encounter failure instead itâ€™s the start of a new beginning of a more LEARNED PERSON. ðŸ˜Š
