On college days, thesis is used to measure the final culmination of learning before graduating with a degree. At that point, I would say I do not fully understand itâ€™s purpose, for me itâ€™s a 6 unit subject that I need to complete and pass in order to graduate. I need to run experiment and analyze its result. Then, publish and defend.

During that time where I have appreciated the value of having adviser. At first, I saw them as teachers giving topics, making sure that I complete my thesis with then my final grade relying on their hands. 

Now, that I am taking this course and looking back (past a decade), I realized how my advisers made step by step assessment on my performance during the start and end of the thesis and how they adjusted based on my response and outcome of my thesis experiments/evaluations. My topic was changed based on preliminary outcome and my personal capability to do a highly theoretical work. The initial topic was highly theoretical and based from their assessment, I am not on that scientist level to do it. Hahaha ðŸ˜Š and so my topic changed to something practical, which I am grateful and it made sense to me that, I still remember it now.

There was a point, I was at risk of not graduating, may analytical samples were discarded accidentally and I havenâ€™t completed my analysis, my laboratory adviser, adjusted her time so as to accommodate the facilitation of the repeat evaluations.

On the other hand, in writing the outcome, my thesis writing adviser, kept on reminding me on the value of coherent write-up. I had to revise my write-up 100x (kidding aside, maybe 5-10 times).  This feedback loop (plus a lot of sleepless days and guidance provided by my adviser), allowed me to successfully complete the thesis (got an excellent grade) and graduated on timeâ€¦ Now, that I am working in a manufacturing firm and I manage people, that I have understood the value of writing coherently and the value of storytelling. Thanks for my adviser, for helping me learn this and itâ€™s now my turn to give back. ðŸ˜Š
