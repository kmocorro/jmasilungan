### My Models and Mentors
List the most important role models and mentors in your life. Then describe what their positive modeling and mentoring have meant to your development.

Role Models and Mentors	Their Contributions
Efren Masilungan – Father	Set a rigid expectation for myself, anything less than perfect is not good enough
Teodora Masilungan – Mother	Provided acceptance of the person I am and encouraged me in times that I feel I am not good enough


The type of role model I want to be for others (other learners)
Describe which characteristics and behaviors you believe are the most important for you to model for your students.

1.	A teacher who shows care and empathy on their student learning more importantly to the student as individual
2.	A person who doesn’t stop on learning and finds joy despite some setback encountered.

How I will incorporate models and mentors in my profession (as an educator)
Allow students to be the best version of themselves and allow them to aim high and be on top but ensure that in case there are misses, show care and encouragement. This can be done by:
(1)	Taking the time to get to know the students
(2)	Set challenging goals for the students
(3)	Build an encouraging environment to learn
(4)	Observe student’s growth and provide assistance if necessary.
 
Who will be my education mentor? What would my ideal education mentor be like?
My education mentor would be my college thesis adviser. She was very knowledgeable and showed me not just compassion but literally walked a mile to support me, many sleepless nights just to finish my thesis. She got my respect because she walked the talk. This in turn, allowed me to finish my thesis (with good mark) and I graduated on time.
