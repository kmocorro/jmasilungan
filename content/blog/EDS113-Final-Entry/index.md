### The End is Just the Beginning

On EDS 113, below are the key learnings that I found better appreciation of the:

(1)	Importance of setting the proper teaching objectives and in making sure that assessments are aligned to it.

(2)	Purpose of Formative Exam â€“ On my university days, I was used on having 2-3 long exams in a subject (in one semester) and thatâ€™s my idea of good assessment. I didnâ€™t realize that quizzes when designed properly can have positive impact on studentâ€™s learning and I would like to include this as part of future assessment (should I become an educator) 

(3)	Value of Summative Exam â€“ I donâ€™t usually like this as a student because itâ€™s tedious but after reading the course, I realized it value. Then, the next step in the future is how to design a simple but meaningful summative assessment (something that the student could look forward to and not something that they would dread).

(4)	Value of group activities â€“ I enjoyed doing the activities in group in this class better that I would have expected it on the start since we do it mostly virtually (best case via ZOOM). Thereâ€™s so much power that groupwork can bring when done properly.

(5)	Compassion â€“ I was the student who was always hard on myself and initially the concern is that, I could be expecting the students to be working hard as well. Now, I was thinking, as a future teacher I should try to make the studentâ€™s life challenging enough but I should also give margins for mistakes (and show support and compassion when needed).

Thanks Doc Lou and EDS113 for this wonderful start of the journey. ðŸ˜Š
