### Hard Sciences: Wired to be Exact

I was wired with the knowledge of exactness. In the Field of Science and Math, everything is accounted for. Each law is absolute with clauses defining its applicability and exceptions. This belief has strengthened more as I work on the field of Science. However, on the later part, as I deal more with people, this changed. In handling people, there is no such thing as exact method.
PTC subjects is an eye opener, wherein several theories about learning are brought about with each one having its bias. For me, they all have something that is right. Unfortunately, none of the single theory captures everything because is learning is dynamic and unique to each individual. Since education is a field that deals with human being, it is hard to put the definition of learning and knowledge is a single theory but personally, I would be happy if I am proven wrong with my statement.  ðŸ˜Š
Learning is a continuous journey, thatâ€™s why I am here â€“ trying to learn what learning is. Fortunately or unfortunately, the more that I learn the more that I feel that thereâ€™s more and more that I donâ€™t understand (which means I need to learn more).
