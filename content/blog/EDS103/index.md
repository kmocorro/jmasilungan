### EDS103 - Module 1: Ejournal A Reflection on Learning

> A Reflection on Learning,  ‚ÄúWhat we are is God's gift to us. What we become is our gift to God.‚Äù ‚Äï Eleanor Powell 


As a child up to our teen years, we get busy on acquiring knowledge, trying to finish school and on getting the ‚Äúlearnings‚Äù needed in order to prepare us for work later on. The results or manifestations of these learnings could take any or combination of the four orientation to learning. Personally, as a student, I am more conscious on the cognitive learning as I felt this was the measure of my capability as a ‚Äúgood student‚Äù and an enabler for landing in a good job. Yeah, I was right, it helped me land on a good job (as an individual technical contributor) but this alone is not enough to sustain career and personal growth.

Now, that I am already working and leading teams, I have found higher appreciation on the behaviorist and social/situational orientation. As one grows, on the career ladder, technical skills are no longer the most important skills, we need to collaborate with people and this is where those two orientations are needed in order to effectively work with teams and get the desired results. As a leader, it is important to understand and demonstrate these two orientations to learning and eventually impart to the team members for future succession.

Similar to learning wherein there are research-based principles and theories, at work, the value of theories can‚Äôt be denied especially that we are dealing with solar products with defined power and aesthetics specification. The basic principles for its operations can be found on text books and internet. However, in order to innovate and lead the market, continuous research and development is being done on our company in order to deliver the highest efficiency cell on high volume manufacturing.

Similar to learning, any product development should continue on and those who are able to innovate the best takes the lead and this shouldn‚Äôt stop unless it cease to exist.

Truly we are all blessed by unlearned skills (breathing, digestive capacity and biological functions) from the time of our birth. These unlearned skills are something that we tend to neglect and not be appreciative as we go on and get busy with our personal lives. We get reminded of the value of unlearned skills when the life of someone dear to us ceases and all that‚Äôs left are memories and learnings that those people imparted to us.

For as long as we live, learning (and sometimes not learning) will continue on. My prayer is that at the end of this life, I hope I have acquired the necessary learnings and was able to contribute to my family, work and to our society in making a difference (as my way of thanking our creator for all the unlearned gifts, life experiences and learning that He gave me; and for the glory of God). üòä
